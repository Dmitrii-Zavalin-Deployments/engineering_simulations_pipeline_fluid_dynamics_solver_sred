    """
    Performs one explicit time step for a fluid simulation using the Navier-Stokes equations.
    This function orchestrates advection, diffusion, and pressure projection steps.

    Args:
        velocity_field (np.ndarray): Current velocity field (U, V, W components)
                                     Shape: (nx, ny, nz, 3).
        pressure_field (np.ndarray): Current pressure field. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
        density (float): Fluid density.
        viscosity (float): Fluid dynamic viscosity.
        dx (float): Grid spacing in x-direction.
        dy (float): Grid spacing in y-direction.
        dz (float): Grid spacing in z-direction.
        dt (float): Time step size.

    Returns:
        tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: Updated velocity_field and pressure_field after one time step.

    Notes on assumed function signatures for imported modules:
    - compute_advection_term(field, velocity_field, mesh_info): Should return advection term.
      (Note: The `advection.py` function takes `mesh_info` dictionary, not `dx, dy, dz, dt` directly.
      You might need to construct `mesh_info` or pass `grid_shape`, `dx`, `dy`, `dz` as individual args.)
    - diffuse(field, viscosity, density, dx, dy, dz, dt): Should return diffused field.
    - calculate_divergence(velocity_field, dx, dy, dz): Should return divergence field.
    - solve_poisson(source_term, dx, dy, dz, tolerance, max_iter): Should return solved scalar field (e.g., pressure correction).
    - correct_pressure(velocity_field, pressure_correction, dx, dy, dz): Should return pressure-corrected velocity field.

    # Assuming 'diffuse' returns the diffused field or updates in place.
    # If `diffuse` calculates the diffusion term (like advection.py does for advection),
    # then you'd apply it similarly: u_star += dt * diffusion_term

    # or P_new = P_old + dt * pressure_correction_source (if pressure_correction is delta_P)

    # This is a simplification; actual pressure updates are more nuanced.
