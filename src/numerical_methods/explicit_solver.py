    Performs one explicit time step for a fluid simulation using the Navier-Stokes equations.
    This function orchestrates advection, diffusion, and pressure projection steps.

    Args:
        velocity_field (np.ndarray): Current velocity field (U, V, W components)
                                     Shape: (nx, ny, nz, 3).
        pressure_field (np.ndarray): Current pressure field. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
        density (float): Fluid density.
        viscosity (float): Fluid dynamic viscosity.
        dx (float): Grid spacing in x-direction.
        dy (float): Grid spacing in y-direction.
        dz (float): Grid spacing in z-direction.
        dt (float): Time step size.

    Returns:
        tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: Updated velocity_field and pressure_field after one time step.

    Notes on assumed function signatures for imported modules:
    - advect(field, velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt): Should return advected field.
    - diffuse(field, viscosity, density, dx, dy, dz, dt): Should return diffused field.
    - calculate_divergence(velocity_field, dx, dy, dz): Should return divergence field.
    - solve_poisson(source_term, dx, dy, dz, tolerance, max_iter): Should return solved scalar field (e.g., pressure correction).
    - correct_pressure(velocity_field, pressure_correction, dx, dy, dz): Should return pressure-corrected velocity field.

    # --- Step 1: Calculate Advection Term ---
    # Advect velocity components using current velocity field
    # Assuming advect function handles 3D velocity components
    # A common approach is to advect each velocity component by the full velocity field
    # If your advect function is more generic, it might look like:
    # U_advected = advect(velocity_field[..., 0], velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt)
    # V_advected = advect(velocity_field[..., 1], velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt)
    # W_advected = advect(velocity_field[..., 2], velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt)
    # For a simplified example, we'll assume advect works on the full velocity field
    # or is called for each component. Let's assume it works on the full field for now,
    # or you'd call it 3 times.

    # Simplified approach: calculate a preliminary velocity field including advection
    # and diffusion. Real implementations are more complex (e.g., splitting schemes).
    
    # Placeholder for advected velocity. You might need to call advect for each component.
    # E.g., velocity_advected_u = advect(velocity_field[..., 0], velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt)
    #       velocity_advected_v = advect(velocity_field[..., 1], velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt)
    #       velocity_advected_w = advect(velocity_field[..., 2], velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt)
    #       velocity_advected = np.stack([velocity_advected_u, velocity_advected_v, velocity_advected_w], axis=-1)
    
    # For this template, let's assume `advect` and `diffuse` can operate on the 3-component velocity field directly.
    # If your functions are component-wise, you'll need to loop or apply numpy slicing.

    # A more common explicit scheme for Navier-Stokes (Fractional Step Method):
    # 1. Compute intermediate velocity (convection + diffusion)
    # 2. Solve for pressure (projection step to enforce incompressibility)
    # 3. Correct velocity based on pressure gradient

    # Start with a copy to avoid modifying the input field prematurely
    u_star = np.copy(velocity_field)

    # 1. Advection Step
    # Assuming 'advect' calculates the advective change and applies it
    # If 'advect' returns a new velocity field, assign it:
    u_star = advect(u_star, velocity_field, dx, dy, dz, dt) 
    # Otherwise, if it updates in-place, the line above should be removed.

    # 2. Diffusion Step
    # Assuming 'diffuse' calculates the diffusive change and applies it
    # If 'diffuse' returns a new velocity field, assign it:
    u_star = diffuse(u_star, viscosity, density, dx, dy, dz, dt)
    # Otherwise, if it updates in-place, the line above should be removed.

    # 3. Add External Forces (if any, e.g., gravity - not in current schema, but common)
    # u_star[..., 2] -= 9.81 * dt # Example for gravity in -z direction

    # --- Step 2: Pressure Projection (ensures incompressibility) ---
    # Compute the divergence of the intermediate velocity field
    divergence = calculate_divergence(u_star, dx, dy, dz)

    # Solve Poisson equation for pressure correction (phi)
    # div(grad(phi)) = divergence / dt
    # This requires a source term, which is divergence / dt
    # The pressure correction field `phi` will have the same shape as pressure_field
    # Note: Tolerance and max_iter for Poisson solver might be passed via simulation_parameters later
    # For now, using hardcoded values
    poisson_tolerance = 1e-6
    poisson_max_iter = 1000

    # Solve for pressure correction, scaled by density
    # The source term for pressure Poisson is usually density * divergence / dt
    pressure_correction_source = density * divergence / dt 
    
    # The `solve_poisson` function should return the pressure correction field
    pressure_correction = solve_poisson(
        pressure_correction_source, dx, dy, dz, 
        tolerance=poisson_tolerance, max_iter=poisson_max_iter
    )

    # Update pressure field: P_new = P_old + pressure_correction
    # The pressure_correction term is directly related to the new pressure.
    # This update method depends on your specific pressure solver formulation.
    # A common approach is P_new = P_old - pressure_correction (if phi is pressure potential)
    # or P_new = P_old + dt * pressure_correction_source (if pressure_correction is delta_P)
    # For this template, let's assume `pressure_correction` directly gives the pressure difference.
    # This is a simplification; actual pressure updates are more nuanced.
    updated_pressure_field = pressure_field + pressure_correction # Or some other formula

    # Correct velocity field using the pressure correction gradient
    # This step ensures the velocity field is divergence-free
    # Assuming correct_pressure takes the intermediate velocity and pressure correction
    updated_velocity_field = correct_pressure(u_star, pressure_correction, density, dx, dy, dz, dt)


    return updated_velocity_field, updated_pressure_field

# Note: The actual implementation details within advect, diffuse, calculate_divergence,
# solve_poisson, and correct_pressure will dictate the exact mathematical operations.
# You will need to ensure the arguments and return values match what is expected here.
