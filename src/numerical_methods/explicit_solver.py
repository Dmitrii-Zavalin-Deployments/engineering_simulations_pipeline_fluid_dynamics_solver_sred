    Performs one explicit time step for a fluid simulation using the Navier-Stokes equations.
    This function orchestrates advection, diffusion, and pressure projection steps.

    Args:
        velocity_field (np.ndarray): Current velocity field (U, V, W components)
                                     Shape: (nx, ny, nz, 3).
        pressure_field (np.ndarray): Current pressure field. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
        density (float): Fluid density.
        viscosity (float): Fluid dynamic viscosity.
        dx (float): Grid spacing in x-direction.
        dy (float): Grid spacing in y-direction.
        dz (float): Grid spacing in z-direction.
        dt (float): Time step size.

    Returns:
        tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: Updated velocity_field and pressure_field after one time step.

    Notes on assumed function signatures for imported modules:
    - compute_advection_term(field, velocity_field, mesh_info): Should return advection term.
    - compute_diffusion_term(field, viscosity, mesh_info): Should return diffusion term.
    - compute_pressure_divergence(u_tentative, mesh_info): Should return divergence field.
    - solve_poisson_for_phi(source_term, mesh_info, time_step, tolerance, max_iter): Should return solved scalar field (e.g., pressure correction).
    - correct_pressure(velocity_field, pressure_correction, dx, dy, dz): Should return pressure-corrected velocity field.

# You will need to ensure the arguments and return values match what is expected here.
