    """
    Performs one implicit time step for a fluid simulation using the Navier-Stokes equations.
    Implicit methods typically involve solving a system of linear equations.
    This is a conceptual placeholder outlining the common steps.

    Args:
        velocity_field (np.ndarray): Current velocity field (U, V, W components).
                                     Shape: (nx, ny, nz, 3).
        pressure_field (np.ndarray): Current pressure field. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
        density (float): Fluid density.
        viscosity (float): Fluid dynamic viscosity.
        dx (float): Grid spacing in x-direction.
        dy (float): Grid spacing in y-direction.
        dz (float): Grid spacing in z-direction.
        dt (float): Time step size.

    Returns:
        tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: Updated velocity_field and pressure_field after one time step.

    Notes:
    - A full implicit solver often requires building and solving a large sparse linear system
      (e.g., using iterative solvers like Conjugate Gradient, GMRES, or preconditioned Krylov methods).
    - The terms (advection, diffusion, pressure gradient) are typically handled simultaneously
      within the linear system, rather than as separate explicit function calls like in the explicit solver.
    - This placeholder illustrates the *intent* of an implicit step by re-using the function names,
      but the internal implementation of those functions (or how they are combined)
      would need to be adapted for implicit formulations.
