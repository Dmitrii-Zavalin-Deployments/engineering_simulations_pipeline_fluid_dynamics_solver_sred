    Applies simplified boundary conditions by tagging edge cells using resolution values.
    Marks cells on the outermost x/y/z faces with 'wall' type; others as 'interior'.

    üß± Strategy-aligned fallback:
    If any resolution axis is zero, the domain is degenerate and all cells are tagged as 'wall'.
    This avoids undefined edge detection logic and ensures consistent state.
